My current and recent research interests include:

## Superconductivity & Josephson junctions

- Planar S/Sm/S Josephson junctions on proximitized two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs)
- Critical-current asymmetry and the superconducting diode effect (SDE)
- Andreev bound states and continuum contributions to the Josephson current
- Temperature and magnetic-field dependence of supercurrents

## Spin–orbit coupling & anisotropy

- Interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin–orbit coupling in semiconductor heterostructures
- Crystalline anisotropy and its impact on SDE and critical currents
- Optimal magnetic-field orientations for maximizing non-reciprocal effects

## Computational & theoretical tools

- Tight-binding simulations using Kwant
- Bogoliubov–de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians
- Numerical evaluation of free energy and supercurrent from spectra
- Analytical models for short and long junction limits

## Broader interests

- Heat and charge transport in hybrid superconducting devices
- Possible connections between non-reciprocal transport and thermodynamic / geometric viewpoints
- Physics education for life-science and pre-med students
