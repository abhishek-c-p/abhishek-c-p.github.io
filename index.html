<p>
I am a PhD candidate in Physics at Wayne State University in Detroit, USA. My research is in theoretical condensed matter
physics, with a focus on superconductivity and non-reciprocal transport in planar Josephson junctions.
</p>

<p>
I work on models of the <strong>superconducting diode effect</strong> in proximitized two-dimensional electron gases,
with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin–orbit coupling, in-plane magnetic fields, and crystalline anisotropy. I use tight-binding
simulations (Kwant) and analytical approaches to understand how symmetry breaking controls critical-current asymmetry.

<h3>Research interests</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Superconductivity and Josephson junctions</li>
  <li>Superconducting diode effect (SDE)</li>
  <li>Rashba &amp; Dresselhaus spin–orbit coupling in 2DEGs</li>
  <li>Magneto-crystalline anisotropy and non-reciprocal transport</li>
  <li>Quantum transport simulations (Kwant, BdG tight-binding)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Teaching &amp; outreach</h3>
<p>
I have taught and assisted in several introductory physics lab and lecture courses for life-science and engineering majors.
I enjoy building clear, intuitive explanations and helping students see physics as a useful language for understanding the world.
