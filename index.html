I am a PhD candidate in Physics at Wayne State University in Detroit, USA. My research is in theoretical condensed matter
physics, with a focus on superconductivity and non-reciprocal transport in planar Josephson junctions.

I work on models of the **superconducting diode effect** in proximitized two-dimensional electron gases,
with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin–orbit coupling, in-plane magnetic fields, and crystalline anisotropy. I use tight-binding
simulations (Kwant) and analytical approaches to understand how symmetry breaking controls critical-current asymmetry.

### Research interests

- Superconductivity and Josephson junctions
- Superconducting diode effect (SDE)
- Rashba & Dresselhaus spin–orbit coupling in 2DEGs
- Magneto-crystalline anisotropy and non-reciprocal transport
- Quantum transport simulations (Kwant, BdG tight-binding)

### Teaching & outreach

I have taught and assisted in several introductory physics lab and lecture courses for life-science and engineering majors.
I enjoy building clear, intuitive explanations and helping students see physics as a useful language for understanding the world.
