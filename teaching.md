## Teaching experience

- Graduate Teaching Assistant, Wayne State University  
  - Introductory physics labs for life-science and pre-med students  
  - University physics labs for science and engineering majors  

I enjoy designing explanations, problem sets, and lab activities that connect physics ideas to real-world contexts and
students' everyday intuition.

## Education

- PhD in Physics, Wayne State University, Detroit, USA (in progress)  
  *Theoretical condensed matter physics; superconductivity and Josephson junctions.*

- BSc / MSc in Physics – *[Add your institution and year here]*  

## Outreach & mentoring

I am interested in:
- Making physics more accessible for students from non-traditional and under-represented backgrounds  
- Developing clear, self-paced learning materials for introductory physics  
- Exploring physics education research and evidence-based teaching practices
