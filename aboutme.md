I am Abhishek C P, a theoretical condensed matter physicist and PhD candidate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy
at Wayne State University, Detroit, USA.

My current research focuses on superconducting hybrid structures, in particular planar Josephson junctions that can exhibit
the *superconducting diode effect*. I work with Bogoliubov–de Gennes tight-binding models, spin–orbit coupling,
and in-plane magnetic fields to understand how symmetry breaking leads to non-reciprocal supercurrents.

Before moving to Detroit for my PhD, I completed my studies in India. Coming from a non-privileged background, I have a strong
interest in making physics education more accessible and less intimidating for first-generation and non-traditional students.

Outside of research, I enjoy teaching, designing clear physics explanations for life-science students, and experimenting with
visualizations, simple simulations, and illustrations to communicate physics concepts.
